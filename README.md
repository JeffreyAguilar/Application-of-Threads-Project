One popular use for thread programming is animation. 

A program that displays an animation shows different objects moving or changing in some way as time progresses. 

This is often achieved by launching one or more threads that compute how parts of the animation change.

In this program, you will see a particular kind of animation, namely the visualization of the steps of the Selection Sort algorithm.

Algorithm animation is an excellent technique for gaining a better understanding of how an algorithm works.
